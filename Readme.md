# circuit simulation and constraint propagation

Translation of some scheme examples from [SCIP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) into python, namely [A Simulator for Digital Circuits](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.4) and [Propagation of Constraints](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.5)

Maybe python is easier to understand than scheme for some. I still recommend reading the book/ original code.

It would be interesting to implement this in a c like language in a data oriented way and with more operations.

I remember that at one point I had the impression that there was a bug in the code of the book but I'm not sure anymore exactly where it was. As soon as I continue expanding this I will try to reread and maybe correct my/ their code.

# Similar work
[bitwise](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise/tree/master/rattle) has another vastly more mature python implementation (rattle) of digital circuit simulation (and simplification) and also videos on youtube about building it.

Because this is unusual for code, but the code had no explicit annotation, I wrote a mail to MIT press and received approval to publish my version based on their examples under the MIT license.

I was very happy to not only have MIT press publish their book for free but also be so responsive and friendly!
