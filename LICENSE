Because this is unusual for code, but the code had no explicit annotation, I wrote a mail to MIT press and received approval to publish my version based on their examples under the MIT license.

Thank you for your message.  Yes, you may post your code which is based on the material found in SCIP 2e under an MIT License.  Please indicate that your code is derived from “A Simulator for Digital Circuits” from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 2e, by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman, published by The MIT Press.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

All best,

I was very happy to not only have MIT press publish their book for free but also be so responsive and friendly!
